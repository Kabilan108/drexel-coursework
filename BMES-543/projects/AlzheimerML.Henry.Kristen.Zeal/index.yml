title: Analysis of Alzheimer’s Disease Gene Expression for Diagnostic Applications

abstract: Here we perform differential expression analysis and classification 
  based on gene expression between patients clinically diagnosed with Alzheimer’s
  Disease and controls. Gene expression data was microarray-based from the brain
  and the blood. We find the sets of differentially expressed genes meeting a
  significance (p<0.05) and fold change (absolute log fold > 0.32) requirement 
  are disjoint between the datasets from blood and brain. Transcripts from the 
  brain are enriched for inflammation, cellular responses to metal ions, and 
  apoptosis. Transcripts from the blood are enriched for translational processes, 
  rRNA processing, and mitochondrial energetics. The pooled differentially expressed 
  genes from all datasets are enriched for pathways involved in neurodegeneration, 
  including Alzheimer’s disease. For classification, we trained a support vector machine 
  classifier to predict disease diagnosis based on gene expression (control vs mild 
  cognitive impairment and control vs Alzheimer’s disease). After feature selection 
  for each task, we were able to achieve a 83.5% Alzheimer’s vs control accuracy and 
  a 80.2% mild cognitive impairment vs control accuracy.
