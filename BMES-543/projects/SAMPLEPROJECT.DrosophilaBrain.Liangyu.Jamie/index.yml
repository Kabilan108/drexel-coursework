title: GUI for Registration of Brains and Neuron Detection
author: Liangyu Tao, Jamie Trihn
abstract: There are many studies on how populations of neurons interact to generate
  everyday behaviors. Confocal imaging has allowed us obtain high resolution images
  of these neurons and their anatomical locations. However, the variations in imaging
  setup across studies make it difficult to perform precise comparisons of neuron
  populations across multiple studies. This project is aimed at creating a graphical
  user interface (GUI) using MATLAB that allows for registration of Drosophila brains
  and cell detection to determine the number of overlapping neurons labeled in both
  brains. We found that the GUI was able to successfully perform registration on 2d
  images. This tool will allow researchers to generate a database of registered brains
  and overlapping cells, which will allow for accurate and efficient mapping of neural
  circuit.
