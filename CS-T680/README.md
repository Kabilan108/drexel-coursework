# CS T680: Computational Network Neuroscience

This course is intended as a broad graduate-level introduction to 
computational neuroscience, with a special focus on brain 
connectivity analysis and network neuroscience. Main goal is to 
introduce this rapidly developing domain of medical research to 
students coming from a computing background. After taking the course, 
the student will become prepared for a postgraduate level research 
experience in the burgeoning field of connectomics.

## Prerequisites

No specific prior knowledge is necessary, but some exposure to graph 
theory at the undergraduate level and some general mathematical 
background, especially on linear algebra are assumed. You should have
fluency in Python, MATLAB, or R (C/C++ can also work, although would 
make it a bit challenging for you).

## Outline

The following topics were covered:

- From raw MR data to brain graphs: data processing
- Connectomics at micro-meso-macro scale
- Mesoscale brain network properties, centrality and hubs in brain, 
  rich clubs
- Motifs, small world, network economy, and modularity in brain 
  networks
- Statistical analysis of connectomes, null models, generative 
  network models
- Applications of machine learning and deep learning on connectomics
- Communication in the brain: structure-function coupling in connectomes
- Connectomics in the analysis of brain diseases and disorders: Traumatic 
  brain injury, autism,neurosurgical planning
- Connectomics in development and aging

## Expected Work

The course has three major components: weekly reading assignments, 
term project, and peer reviews .

1. **Readings:** You will be assigned one journal article every week 
   to be read and summarized in 1 page before the class. Your summary 
   should include the main highlights of the paper, and include a brief 
   review of your opinion about the study.
2. **Term Project:** There will be a term project with 4 milestones, 
   where you will do connectomic analysis. You can either pick a research 
   paper to replicate its results and then expand it, or design your own 
   study. Milestones will be as follows:
  - Week 3: Present project idea and background
    - find a problem and a data set, write a 2 page report stating the 
      problem, as well as providing a background from the literature. 
      Report should have 1 figure that visually conveys the message of 
      the project.
  - Week 5: Preliminary data analysis results report
    - Do standard graph theory measures as well as more advanced analysis 
      by using methods such as linear models, machine learning, deep 
      learning etc.
    - 3 page report with 2-3 figures
  - Week 7: More advanced data anlysis report
    - Do analysis using methods such as linear models, machine learning, 
      deep learning etc.
    - 3 page report with 2-3 figures (results should be different than the 
      report 2)
  - **Week 10:** Final results report
    - in a paper format, with intro, results, and discussion
    - Results section should contain results from report 2 and 3
    - Should be a 6 page paper
    - There will be project presentations at week 10 in class.
3. **Peer review:** For each report, you will review the report of one of 
   your friendâ€™s, and write a 1 page review to give feedback to your friend.
