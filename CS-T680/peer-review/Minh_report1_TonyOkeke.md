- This seems to be more of an outline of your report than an actual draft. You need to
  work on the formatting; nothing fancy but having it better organized would help.
  You can start off by splitting it into Introduction and Methods sections.

- You do not really provide much background information about the Autism or the 
  Machine Learning methods you intend to use.

- I also think you need to include references to at least 4 or 5 other papers so that 
  it is clear that you are acknowledging recent research in the field. Below is a list
  of some of the papers I found useful when writing my first draft. 
  - *Tunç, B., Pandey, J., St. John, T., Meera, S.S., Maldarelli, J.E., Zwaigenbaum, L., Hazlett, H.C., Dager, S.R., Botteron, K.N., Girault, J.B. and McKinstry, R.C., 2021. Diagnostic shifts in autism spectrum disorder can be linked to the fuzzy nature of the diagnostic boundary: a data‐driven approach. Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 62(10), pp.1236-1245.*
  - *Shen, L., Zhao, Y., Zhang, H., Feng, C., Gao, Y., Zhao, D., Xia, S., Hong, Q., Iqbal, J., Liu, X. K., et al.(2019). Advances in biomarker studies in autism spectrum disorders.Reviews on Biomarker Studiesin Psychiatric and Neurodegenerative Disorders, pages 207–233*
  
- Your description of machine learning is very basic. You should aim to provide a better 
  description of what ML methods you plan on using and why - references would be helpful in
  making that point. 
  - This paper describes an interesting model that was developed for the prediction of
    developmental outcomes in infants. If your goal is to develop a deep learning based
    classifier for autistic connectomes, it might be helpful to give it a read.

- You didn't include a figue to summarize the project plan. You can take a look at Figure 1 in [this](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053811919304562) paper to get some inspiration.

- Also, considering that my paper is still only a first draft, I do not think it is appropriate to have it listed as a reference.

- The text under "Solution" should be the start of your Methods section. You should describe
  the dataset in clearer detail. The focus should be on more clearly explaining the approach
  you intend to take - if you are developing a CNN, you should include some background information about deep learning and its applications to connectomics in the introduction.

- Overall, I do not think it is fair to judge this as a draft report. More work needs to be
  done to flesh out the details of the project. However, I do think that you have included
  all the basic information so it should simply be a matter of expanding on what you already have here.
