# Exploring the Impact of Autism Spectrum Disorder on the Structural Connectome

### Peer Review Comments

<hr>

- I think your introduction provides sufficient background information about connectomics and ASD.


- For the results section, I think you should leave out the sections where you are interpreting the findings and move them to the discussion section.
  - In my opinion, this will improve the flow of the paper and make it easier to follow.
- In addition to reporting the SVM accuracy, you should consider including some other 
  metrics for model perfomance such as evaluating the AUC for the ROC curve.
- I find it interesting that you did not identify any significantly different measures
  for the Schaefer connectomes. I'm also working on this data set and I did identify 
  a handful of signficant differences - maybe take a look at the data again (I will do the
  same on my end as well).

- Overall, I think you did an excellent job with this draft.
