  abstract = {Memories may be encoded in the brain via strongly interconnected groups of neurons, called assemblies. The concept of Hebbian plasticity suggests that these assemblies are generated through synaptic plasticity, strengthening the recurrent connections within select groups of neurons that receive correlated stimulation. To remain stable in absence of such stimulation, the assemblies need to be self-reinforcing under the plasticity rule. Previous models of such assembly maintenance require additional mechanisms of fast homeostatic plasticity often with biologically implausible timescales. Here we provide a model of neuronal assembly generation and maintenance purely based on spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) between excitatory neurons. It uses irregularly and stochastically spiking neurons and STDP that depresses connections of uncorrelated neurons. We find that assemblies do not grow beyond a certain size, because temporally imprecisely correlated spikes dominate the plasticity in large assemblies. Assemblies in the model can be learned or spontaneously emerge. The model allows for prominent, stable overlap structures between static assemblies. Further, assemblies can drift, particularly according to a novel, transient overlap-based mechanism. Finally the model indicates that assemblies grow in the aging brain, where connectivity decreases.},

  abstract = {Neuromodulators play a ubiquitous role across the brain in regulating plasticity. With recent advances in experimental techniques, it is possible to study the effects of diverse neuromodulatory states in specific brain regions. Neuromodulators are thought to impact plasticity predominantly through two mechanisms: the gating of plasticity and the upregulation of neuronal activity. However, the consequences of these mechanisms are poorly understood and there is a need for both experimental and theoretical exploration. Here we illustrate how neuromodulatory state affects cortical plasticity through these two mechanisms. First, we explore the ability of neuromodulators to gate plasticity by reshaping the learning window for spike-timing-dependent plasticity. Using a simple computational model, we implement four different learning rules and demonstrate their effects on receptive field plasticity. We then compare the neuromodulatory effects of upregulating learning rate versus the effects of upregulating neuronal activity. We find that these seemingly similar mechanisms do not yield the same outcome: upregulating neuronal activity can lead to either a broadening or a sharpening of receptive field tuning, whereas upregulating learning rate only intensifies the sharpening of receptive field tuning. This simple model demonstrates the need for further exploration of the rich landscape of neuromodulator-mediated plasticity. Future experiments, coupled with biologically detailed computational models, will elucidate the diversity of mechanisms by which neuromodulatory state regulates cortical plasticity.},

  abstract = {Near coincidental pre- and postsynaptic action potentials induce associative long-term potentiation (LTP) or long-term depression (LTD), depending on the order of their timing. Here, we show that in visual cortex the rules of this spike-timing-dependent plasticity are not rigid, but shaped by neuromodulator receptors coupled to adenylyl cyclase (AC) and phospholipase C (PLC) signaling cascades. Activation of the AC and PLC cascades results in phosphorylation of postsynaptic glutamate receptors at sites that serve as specific "tags" for LTP and LTD. As a consequence, the outcome (i.e., whether LTP or LTD) of a given pattern of pre- and postsynaptic firing depends not only on the order of the timing, but also on the relative activation of neuromodulator receptors coupled to AC and PLC. These findings indicate that cholinergic and adrenergic neuromodulation associated with the behavioral state of the animal can control the gating and the polarity of cortical plasticity.},
