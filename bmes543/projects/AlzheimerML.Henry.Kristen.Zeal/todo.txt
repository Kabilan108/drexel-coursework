* Train & test ML model for the first dataset. Cross-validation. AD vs. Control.
* Train ML model on the entire first dataset, test it on the second dataset. (Independent validation).
    * Future: If the ML method produces scores, see if scores are correlated with severity levels.
* Future: Put 3th & 4th datasets on the back-burner. (Will use Homologene).
