title: Meta Analysis of COVID-19 Patient Data

abstract: For this study, three datasets were used 
  to analyze similar differentially expressed genes 
  in covid-19 patients and healthy patients. If successful, 
  this could greatly assist with treatment due to 
  the pathophysiology information now being understood and cataloged. T
  he three data sets were analyzed separately using MATlab, then integrated 
  at the end to be compared. Since the data sets were so large, 
  only the top 10% was used in this analysis to allow for MATlab to handle 
  the large amounts of data. We found data sets 1 and 2 had a large 
  quantity of shared differentially expressed genes.
