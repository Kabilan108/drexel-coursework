title: Identifying Immune-Related Genes in Calcific Aortic Valve Stenosis
author: Ryan Byrne, Pratishta Gluckhool
Abstract: Calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS) is the second most common cardiovascular disease after 
coronary heart disease, affecting approximately 0.4% of the general population. Around 2.8% of the 
elderly population develop varying degrees of the disease and 25% of elderly people aged above 65 
are at a higher risk of suffering from CAVS. There is currently no effective treatment to reduce the 
progression of the disease and the underlying mechanisms of calcification and chronic inflammation 
remain largely unknown. Here, we intend to identify the differentially expressed immune-related genes 
between normal and CAVS samples in both the training and testing datasets using the Support 
Vector Machine Recursive Feature Elimination Model. Our data show that CAVS can be 
characterized by the gene expression levels of 280 differentially expressed genes, including 76 
immune-related genes, suggesting that these genes may be involved in the development and 
progression of CAVS. Our results may provide a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms 
of the disease and may help to develop effective treatment strategies to reduce the progression of 
the disease.
