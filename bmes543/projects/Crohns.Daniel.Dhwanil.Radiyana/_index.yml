abstract: Crohn’s disease is a chronic gastrointestinal   inflammatory condition that can result in lesions throughout   the gastrointestinal tract. By identifying the genes associated   with the disease, patient samples can be sequenced and analyzed   to determine if the disease is present or not. The purpose of   this project was to evaluate various  machine learning models’   performances in predicting Crohn’s disease from terminal ileal   samples. Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Logistic   Regression learning models were tested and different feature   selection strategies were used. We concluded that using   significant genes in combination with Support Vector Machine   and Logistic Regression machine learning models lead to the   best accuracies when predicting Crohn’s disease.
