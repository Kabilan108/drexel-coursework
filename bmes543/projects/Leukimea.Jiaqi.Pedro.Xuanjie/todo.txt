May 12:
* Build & test model (Cross-validate) using GSE13425.

 - Filter 90%
 - 10 fold cross-validate
 - top 100 genes
 - T ALL vs. B ALL for now, no need to worry about subtypes
 - Wednesday 6pm complete individual model and testing


May 19:
 * Train using GSE13425 and test on GSE13351.

 	using intersection, find shared GENE in two dataset.
	in both dataset, remove not shared GENE
	
	After selection, move on to training and testing on 1st dataset.
	After, train the entire dataset, and test on 2nd dataset.

May 27:
    unequal amount of sample, m-learning will have issue
    m-learning test: B ALL vs T ALL

June 02:

    Things todo:
    Download both GSE - completed
    Read and translate both GSE - completed
    Get intersection - completed
    Training and testing on GSE13425 - incomplete 
        - just like machinelearning, do cross-validation using self created function, then calculate fold change, accuracy
    Test on GSE13351 - incomplete - GSE13425 as trainer, GSE13351 as tester 
        - input: own function(training filtered(GSE13425),training relapse(GSE13425),testing filtered(GSE13351), testing relapse(GSE13351))
