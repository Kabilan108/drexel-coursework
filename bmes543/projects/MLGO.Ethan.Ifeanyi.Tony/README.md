### Abstract

By analyzing 34,524 probes in 10 cancer types across 20 data sets (tumor versus 
normal) from the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array (GPL570) 
microarray platform, we built a multioutput logistic regression classifier to 
predict gene ontology (GO) enrichment for a small subset of important terms. 
By using a leave-one-out cross validation classification accuracy, we displayed 
that such a prediction is possible with accuracies ranging from as 45% - 80% for 
22  gene ontology terms.  After implementing a forward feature selection on our 
gene feature set accuracies improved, ranging from 80% - 100%. Our findings 
potentially highlight that specific gene expression levels play a vital role in 
mapping to gene ontology terms. This would also indicate that selected genes are 
most responsible for the functional properties of a given gene product.
