abstract: By analyzing 34,524 probes in 10 cancer types across 20 data sets 
  (tumor versus normal) from the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 
  Array (GPL570) microarray platform, we built a multioutput logistic regression 
  classifier to predict gene ontology (GO) enrichment for a small subset of 
  important terms. By using a leave-one-out cross validation classification 
  accuracy, we displayed that such a prediction is possible with accuracies 
  ranging from as 45% - 80% for  22  gene ontology terms.  After implementing a 
  forward feature selection on our gene feature set accuracies improved, ranging 
  from 80% - 100%. Our findings potentially highlight that specific gene 
  expression levels play a vital role in mapping to gene ontology terms. This 
  would also indicate that selected genes are most responsible for the 
  functional properties of a given gene product.
