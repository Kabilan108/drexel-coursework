abstract:
  Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is a highly aggressive cancer with an average 5-year survival
  of less than 10%. The high lethality is due to the lack of early diagnosis, extensive heterogenity, 
  rapid metastasis, and limited treatment response. Due to the strong desmoplastic (growth of fibrous tissue
  around cancer) reaction and neoplastic epithelial cells representing a minority population of cancer cells, 
  current PDAC microarray studies have been limited. In this study, we identified overlapping differentially expressed
  genes in 3 datasets and determine their biological significance using python and developed a machine learning model to predict
  the tumor vs normal cells. Our analysis identified overlapping significant genes where greater than 66 percent
  of the genes have been captured in previous studies or are known precursors in oncogenic signaling pathways. Our machine
  learning models resulted in greater than 85 percent cross-validation accuracy for higher volume sample sets. Our findings
  using this model may address the limitations in characterizing PDAC to improve early diagnosis, therapeutic efficacy
  and clinical outcomes.
