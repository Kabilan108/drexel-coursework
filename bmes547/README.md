# BMES 547: Machine Learning in Biomedical Applications

## Course Description:

Machine Learning is a computational approach for construction of algorithms that can 
learn from and make predictions on data. The focus in the course is on delivering a 
practical approach that can help appropriate utilization of machine learning methods 
for relevant data exploration and prediction tasks in biomedical applications. 
Applications will be drawn from bioinformatics, neuro-engineering, and biomedical image 
analysis, with special emphasis given to feature extraction and representation 
strategies specific to the data types prevalent in these domains. The machine learning 
concepts and methods will include parameter density estimation, dimension reduction, 
supervised and unsupervised learning, neural networks, and support vector machines.

## Course Objectives

1. To gain practical knowledge in machine learning tasks and develop ability to utilize 
   available tools in biomedical applications.
2. To learn the basic concepts and techniques of exploratory data analysis, pattern 
   classification, and data clustering.
3. To gain experience in data representation and feature extraction strategies in 
   biomedical applications.
