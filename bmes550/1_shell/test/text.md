Demand for certain products and services varies greatly depending on the weather. For example, users are much more likely to search for information on amusement parks on a hot, sunny day than if it's cold and raining. An amusement park company may want to increase their bids when the weather is nice, but doing so every day would require a lot of manual work. With AdWords scripts, however, it's possible to programmatically fetch weather information and adjust bids in a matter of minutes.

This script uses Google Spreadsheets to store the list of campaigns and their associated locations. A call to the OpenWeatherMap API is made for each location and weather conditions are calculated using some basic rules. If a rule evaluates to true, then a corresponding location bid multiplier is applied to the location targeting for the campaign.
