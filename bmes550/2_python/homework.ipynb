The figure is also given below. The numbers within each node indicate #controls/#prostate-cancer cases. Your function needs to have an input argument for each variable being tested. Your function should calculate and return #prostate/(#numprostate + #control). You need to decide for yourself what input arguments should be given to this function. One should be able to use your function to obtain the Prostate Risk value for a new patient. Demonstrate your function with three test cases that fall under separate nodes in the decision tree.\n",
