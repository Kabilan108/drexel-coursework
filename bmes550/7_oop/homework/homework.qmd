  your `.m` class file, and your own published `bmeimg_test.pdf`
- Implement a `bmeimg` class that can be used with the `bmeimg_test.m` script.
- Test script: [bmeimg_test.mlx](bmeimg_test.mlx). Sample published file:
  [bmeimg_test.pdf](https://sacan.biomed.drexel.edu/lib/exe/fetch.php?rev=&media=course:bcomp2:oo.m:bmeimg_test.pdf)
- If you work in python, define your Python class in a file named `bmeimg.py`.
  Translate the `bmeimg_test` script to a Jupyter notebook. Import the `bmeimg` class
  into your Jupyter notebook.
