    "# Object-Oriented Programming in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects\n",
    "and their interactions to design and program applications. In OOP, computer\n",
    "programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one\n",
    "another. OOP languages are diverse, but the most popular ones are class-based,\n",
    "meaning that objects are instances of classes, which also determine their types.\n",
    "For further reading, see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), [What is Object-Oriented Programming](https://www.stroustrup.com/whatis.pdf) by Bjarne Stroustrup, and [Object-Oriented Programming](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_classes_objects.htm) by Tutorialspoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nomenclature\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Classes** are the blueprints for creating objects. They determine the\n",
    "  attributes and methods of objects.\n",
    "* **Objects** are the instances of classes. These are collections of data\n",
    "  (variables) and a set of procedures (methods) that act on the data.\n",
    "* **Attributes** are the variables that are contained in a class or object.\n",
    "* **Methods** are the functions that are contained in a class or object.\n",
    "* **Object-oriented analysis** is the process of identifying the objects in a\n",
    "  problem domain and their relationships; this produces a set of requirements.\n",
    "* **Object-oriented design** is the process of designing classes and objects to\n",
    "  satisfy the requirements of a problem domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constructing a Class\n",
    "\n",
    "- Typically, to instantiate a class, you call a special method called the\n",
    "  constructor. The constructor is a method that is called when an object is\n",
    "  created from a class and it allows the class to initialize the attributes of\n",
    "  the class.\n",
    "- The constructor is defined using the `__init__` method. This method is called\n",
    "  automatically every time the class is being used to create a new object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Static Attributes and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "- Static attributes and methods are attributes and methods that are shared by\n",
    "  all instances of a class. They are not specific to any object.\n",
    "- Static attributes and methods are defined outside of the constructor, but\n",
    "  inside the class definition.\n",
    "- Static attributes and methods are accessed using the class name and the dot\n",
    "  operator, as in `ClassName.attribute` or `ClassName.method()`.\n",
    "- Static attributes and methods are typically used to store constants that are\n",
    "  applicable to all instances of the class.\n",
    "- Static attributes and methods are also used to define utility functions that\n",
    "  are applicable to all instances of the class.\n",
    "- Technically, any method can be called in a static context if it is called on\n",
    "  the class name instead of an object, with the implicity object passed\n",
    "  explicitly as the first argument. However, this is not recommended.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  pt = Point()\n",
    "  Point2D.setPoint(pt, 3, 4)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- Alternatively, static methods can be defined using the `@staticmethod`\n",
    "  decorator. \n",
    "  - A **decorator** is a special kind of function that modifies the functionality\n",
    "    of another function. Decorators are called by placing an `@` symbol followed\n",
    "    by the name of the decorator function above the definition of the function\n",
    "    to be decorated.\n",
    "  - This will mark the method as static so that it can only be called on the\n",
    "    class name and not on an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instance Attributes and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instance attributes and methods are attributes and methods that are specific\n",
    "  to a particular instance of a class. They are not shared by all instances of\n",
    "  the class.\n",
    "- Instance attributes and methods are defined inside the constructor, using the\n",
    "  `self` parameter.\n",
    "- Instance attributes and methods are accessed using the object name and the dot\n",
    "  operator, as in `objectName.attribute` or `objectName.method()`.\n",
    "- Instance attributes and methods are typically used to store data that is\n",
    "  applicable to a particular instance of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Implicit `self` Parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instance methods require at least one parameter - an *implicit parameter*\n",
    "- This refers to the object itself, and by convention, this parameter is named\n",
    "  `self`.\n",
    "- `self` is used to access methods and attributes of the class within the class\n",
    "  itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encapsulation is the process of combining data and functions into a single\n",
    "  unit, or class. This allows the data to be hidden from the user, and only\n",
    "  accessible through the class methods.\n",
    "- Encapsulation is used to hide the implementation details of a class from other\n",
    "  objects.\n",
    "- In python, programmers have direct access to attributes. This isn't the case\n",
    "  in most other languages, where attributes are hidden from the user.\n",
    "- Ideally, outside of the class itself, *attributes should only be accessed and\n",
    "  modified through the class methods*.\n",
    "  - This provides a level of **abstraction**, and allows the class to change\n",
    "    implementation details without affecting the user.\n",
    "- In python, we can use the double underscore `__` to make an attribute private.\n",
    "  - This prevents the attribute from being accessed outside of the class.\n",
    "  - This is a convention, and not a rule. The attribute can still be accessed\n",
    "    outside of the class.\n",
    "  - This is also known as *attribute mangling*.\n",
    "    - Mangling means that python changes the name of the attribute to include\n",
    "      the class name.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Public Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "- The public interface of a class is the set of methods that can be used by\n",
    "  other objects.\n",
    "- The public interface should only expose the functionality that is necessary\n",
    "  for other objects to use the class.\n",
    "- At some point, you'll likely want to update the implementation of a class.\n",
    "  - It is important that the public interface of the class remains the same.\n",
    "- The first part of the public interface is a set of methods for reading and\n",
    "  writing data from/to the attributes. These are:\n",
    "  - `getters` - methods for reading data from the attributes\n",
    "  - `setters` - methods for writing data to the attributes\n",
    "  - Not all attributes need to have both a getter and a setter.\n",
    "  - There may be `inspectors` - methods for checking the validity of the data\n",
    "    in the attributes; and `mutators` - methods for modifying the data in the\n",
    "    attributes."

    "### Objects are Copied by Reference\n",
    "\n",
    "- When an object is assigned to a variable, the variable is assigned a reference\n",
    "  to the object.\n",
    "- This means that the variable is not a copy of the object, but a reference to\n",
    "  the object.\n",
    "- This means that if you change the object through one of the references, the\n",
    "  object will be changed through all of the references.\n",
    "- To make a copy of an object, you can use the `copy` module.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  import copy\n",
    "  pt1 = Point(3, 4)\n",
    "  pt2 = copy.copy(pt1)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- You can also implement the `__copy__` method to define how an object should\n",
    "  be copied.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "    def __copy__(self):\n",
    "        return Point(self.x, self.y)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- You can also implement the `__deepcopy__` method to define how an object\n",
    "  should be copied recursively.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "    def __deepcopy__(self, memo):\n",
    "        return Point(copy.deepcopy(self.x, memo), copy.deepcopy(self.y, memo))\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  - The `memo` parameter is a dictionary that keeps track of the objects that\n",
    "    have already been copied.\n",
    "- Finally, you can implement a `copy` method to define how an object should be\n",
    "  copied.\n",

    "### Returning `self` from Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "- When a method returns a value, the value is returned to the caller.\n",

    "- Python doesn't have a direct way of making certain attributes read-only.\n",
    "- Instead, you can define a method with the `@property` decorator. This will\n",
    "  then act as a read-only attribute.\n",
    "- Properties are typically implemented for things that are calculated from \n",
    "  (depend on) other attributes of the object.\n",
    "- You can always use a function/method for the same purporse; properties give\n",
