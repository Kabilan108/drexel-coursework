Write a MATLAB script `cctests.m` that compiles and runs the programs you write for
each of the questions below. You need to perform your own tests to demonstrate your
C/C++ program works as intended. Publish this script to a pdf. Submit all of your
.m, .cc, and .pdf files.

::: {.callout-note}
## `simplecalculator.cc`

Write a program that that takes three command line arguments: two numbers separated
with one of the four arithmetic operators (+, -, \*, /), and prints out the result of
this arithmetic expression.

## `average5.cc`

Write a program that takes 5 numbers from the command line and prints their average.

## `mat2x2_inv.cc`

Write a program that takes 4 numbers as command line arguments, representing a 2-by-2
matrix (numbers are given in row-order, the first row first, second row next). Take
the inverse of this matrix and print the inverse as a 1-by-4 vector (again, in
row-order)
