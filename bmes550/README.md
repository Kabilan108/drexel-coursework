# BMES 550: Advanced Biocomputational Languages

## Course Description

This course provides hands-on education in programming languages used in biomedical applications. 
Specific programming languages explored will reflect the current state of practice and may 
include one or more of MATLAB, Python, R, Php, C/C++, and Java languages. This course focuses on 
advanced programming topics including data communication, high performance computing, database 
systems, web interactions, and graphical and web interfaces. The principal application areas to 
be investigated include Bioinformatics (algorithms on strings and sequences), image analysis, 
feedback and control systems, and network modeling and simulation.
