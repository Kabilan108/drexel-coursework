abstract: Melanoma is a rapidly growing and fatal cancer. However, if caught early, 
it can be treated. Early detection and self monitoring is crucial to decrease mortality. 
With melanomaâ€™s prevalence in the United States on the rise, there is a need for a self 
monitoring app that can track the growth and assess the risk of potentially malignant moles. 
Therefore, a series of linked web pages,  Matlab code, and a database were created for individuals 
to track the progression or advancement of a potentially malignant mole that could be diagnosed as 
Melanoma.   The web pages were created in PHP, where users login or create an account which compares 
and/or stores this  user information into a table in SQLite database. Then able to upload an image of 
a suspicious mole. The image was then evaluated in Matlab based on diameter with a qualitative (i.e.,
 high, moderate, or low) risk based on the diameter. The image, diameter, and risk were then presented 
to the user on a new page where they can also evaluate the growth history of the given mole. This mole 
information was also stored in the database. This process can be used for multiple users and multiple 
moles per user. In conclusion, the hope for this project is to assist patients in self-assessment of suspicious 
 moles to potentially increase the detection rate, which could reduce unnecessary melanoma related deaths due to
late-stage diagnosis.
