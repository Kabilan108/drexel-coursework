title: Neurocritical Care Predictor
author: Zack Goldblum, Josh Miller, Kevin Ramirez Chavez
abstract: Patients with severe neurological and neurosurgical conditions are
  treated at Neurocritical Care Units (NICU). These patients present a combination
  of unique conditions which makes it difficult for the physician to provide an 
  accurate treatment thus, resulting on a higher mortality risk for the patients.
  This project's purpose is to provide this physicians with an additional screening 
  tool for new patients. This tool will collect relevant information from the patient
  and correlate it with the MIMIC database. This database present the information of 
  other neurocritical care patients with multiple conditions. The technique presented 
  in this work is the finding of patients with similar conditions to the ones of the 
  new patient and, based on their past outcome, predict the mortality risk for the patient.
