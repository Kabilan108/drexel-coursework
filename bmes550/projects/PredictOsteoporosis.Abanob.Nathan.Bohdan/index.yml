title: Osteoporosis Predictor
author: Abanob Elias, Nathan Pentecost, Bohdan Tkachov
abstract: Osteoporosis is a condition where one's bones become brittle and fragile. This can be from
  loss of tissue or lack of calcium and vitamin D over time. There is no simple and quick evaluation
  for osteoporosis other than sophisticated scans, such as DXA, used to measure bone mineral density
  as a primary method of diagnosis. The study aims to assist primary care physicians to evaluate
  patients' risk without the need for expensive and invasive procedures as a preliminary discovery
  method. This study will be a GUI that predicts the percentage of osteoporosis based on a variety of
  risk factors and parameters inputted by the user. The primary user base of the GUI will be
  physicians or healthcare professionals. It asks for the patient's name, age, gender, grip strength,
  height, weight, number of fractures the patient had, race or ethnicity, if they have a vitamin
  deficiency, history of maternal fractures, and if they are a smoker. The GUI will send the inputs
  to a database which will compare the patient's data to pre-existing patients and will predict the
  patient's risk of osteoporosis through a series of calculations. The GUI will generate a pie chart
  that will display the percentages or likelihood of having osteoporosis based on historical
  diagnoses. The output of the pie chart will show percentages of having osteoporosis (Yes), not
  having osteoporosis (No), and an uncertainty percentage (Unknown) that instructs the user for
  further assessment of the patient.
