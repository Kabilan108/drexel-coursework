abstract: Each of the additional lines of the abstract should be indented with 2 spaces.
  The database created included 51 centers in Hawaii. The scope is small because all of the center information 
  needed to be manually inputted in addition to the abilities of the devices running the code being unable to run 
  such large amounts of data. The choice of Hawaii was used to encapsulate a smaller scope of the general population. 
  With Hawaii being made up of  multiple islands as well as having a high amount of centers for the overall area 
  of the state, it was an optimal choice to use for our database. The code developed in this project is the starting 
  point for a much larger project. In the future, the scope of this project could be broadened to include additional 
  states or locations worldwide.
