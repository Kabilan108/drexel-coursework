title: Risk of Developing Breast Cancer in US Women
author: Landon Leininger, Isabella Spinelli, Demetri Tsitsios
abstract: Breast cancer is a disease that affects a large number of women in the United States, and
  it is a disease that has numerous risk factors associated with it. In using a woman's known risk
  factors to determine her risk of developing breast cancer, the woman can be more knowledgeable of
  this risk and work to control certain risk factors that she is capable of influencing. This
  graphical user interface (GUI) calls for the user to input her own risk factors, such as age,
  race/ethnicity, etc., and it outputs the percentage of known US women with these same risk factors
  who have a history of breast cancer. This application involves a MATLAB GUI with numerous dropdown
  menus corresponding to different risk factors. It interacts with an SQL database of mammogram data
  from US women. A separate MATLAB function searches women in this database who have risk factors
  associated with those inputted by the user, and it outputs the subsequent percentage who have a
  history of breast cancer. The results are shown in a pie chart with up to three sections:
  percentage of women with a history of breast cancer, percentage of women with no history of breast
  cancer, and percentage of women with an unknown history of breast cancer, all with the risk factors
  inputted by the user.
