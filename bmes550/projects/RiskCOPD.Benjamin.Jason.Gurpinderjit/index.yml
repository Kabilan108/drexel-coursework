title: Graphical User Interface (GUI) Platform to Estimate Chronic Obstruc-tive Pulmonary Disorder (COPD) from User-Given Risk Factors
author: Ben Barrett, Jason Huang, Gurpinderjit Judge
abstract: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder (COPD) affects millions of people in the US, with an
  estimated prevalence of up to 10% of the US population. Sever-al risk factors for developing COPD 
  include age, smoking habits, genetic mutations or the presence of variants, and exercise habits. Literature
  reviews demonstrate that there are few comprehensive risk calculators, specifically for COPD and designed for
  both user and physician interaction. Here, we demon-strate the feasibility of a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
  based platform to deliver a risk score to pa-tients, and an interactive platform for physicians to determine a
  patientâ€™s changing risk score. Despite the feasibility of the platform itself, future alterations will be needed
  to validate in the output results for both patients and physicians
