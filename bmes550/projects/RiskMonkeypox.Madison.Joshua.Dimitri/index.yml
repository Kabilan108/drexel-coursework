title: Monkeypox Risk Calculator
author: Madison White , Dimitri Kounis , Joshua Yang
abstract: We developed a Monkeypox Risk Calculator (MRC) that 
will calculate the risk of a person’s demographic. Specific 
parameters include the user’s age, ethnicity, gender, 
vaccination status, and region they live in. Data from the 
Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was imported
to create a SQL database which had the number of cases based 
on demographic parameters such as ethnicity and vaccination 
status. The MRC was created through MATLAB’s AppDesigner. 
The MRC will display a user’s risk as well as summary plots. 
Once a parameter is chosen by the user, all the cases are 
shown binned by that parameter (i.e. age ranges, cases per 
state). The percent of cases that match their demographic, 
for example, all male cases, will be shown to them next to 
the summary plots.
