title: Cholesterol Tracker
author: Jess Baggett, Grace Fan, Majo Garcia
abstract: One of the leading causes of death in the United States is heart disease. The most common type of heart
  disease is coronary artery disease. High cholesterol is associated with a higher risk in cardiovascular
  disease. Therefore, being able to keep track of cholesterol is important if a person is at risk for high
  cholesterol. Healthy adults usually get their cholesterol checked every four to six years, but those
  who have heart disease, diabetes, or a family history of high cholesterol, have to get
  their cholesterol checked more frequently. Additionally, it is recommended for older adults, 
  to receive annual cholesterol tests. This means that patients at risk of high cholesterol will
  have to visit the doctor's rather often to make sure their cholesterol levels are not too high. 
  Moreover, checking cholesterol regularly will keep a person at risk of high cholesterol 
  from plaque buildup in their arteries, which could lead to heart disease or stroke. This project 
  utilizes two MATLAB GUI's where the user would input their own data and keeps track of patients' cholesterol 
  test information and analyzes this information to return if their levels are low, normal, or high, 
  provide recommendations according to those levels, and a 10-year risk assessment for a hard coronary 
  heart disease. It also allows a patient to determine if their cholesterol levels are risky in the comfort 
  of their own home.
