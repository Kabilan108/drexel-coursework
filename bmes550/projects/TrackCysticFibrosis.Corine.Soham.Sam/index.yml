title: Cystic Fibrosis Survey
author: Corine Lontoc, Soham Patel, Sam Schonwald
abstract: Existing questionnaires used in monitoring symptoms for Cystic Fibrosis (CF) 
  are not specific to the disease, and are used for multiple different diseases. 
  Available digital applications focus on one area of symptoms, such as respiratory or 
  digestive issues, without incorporating a broader range of symptoms. We have created 
  a Cystic Fibrosis tracking system utilizing Matlab functions and  GUI applications as 
  well as SQLite databases that cover both digestive and respiratory symptoms caused by 
  Cystic Fibrosis. This tracking system is user specific to ensure privacy and retains 
  all symptom inputs which enables users to view previous symptoms for later comparison.
