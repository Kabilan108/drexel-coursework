abstract:
  Tracking and quantifying individuals' dietary consumption over time can be 
  critical for actively maintaining/achieving a healthy lifestyle. Monitoring
  parameters like caloric, carbohydrate, vitamin, and fat intake throughout one's
  everyday life can inform them of necessary dietary changes, exercise regimens,
  weight loss, supplements, et cetera to employ to live a healthy life. However, 
  the time-consuming burden of reading labels and doing math for every meal
  consumed can discourage individuals from tracking nutritional information
  manually. This study, therefore, aims to create a user-friendly graphical
  user interface (GUI) that allows users to input the meals they consume over a 
  certain period, and automatically generates different nutritional information
  about those meals like calories and vitamins by accessing data from the USDA's
  Food and Nutrient Databse for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) databases to provide users
  a more active way to take control of their health.
